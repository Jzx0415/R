## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(Stat2Data)
num_reds <- seq(1,35,1)

prob_by_num_reds<-data.frame(num_reds)%>%
  mutate(prob=map_dbl(num_reds,prob_red_spheres))
prob_by_num_reds%>%head(3)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
